Create a google sheets (or other .csv) document with the following schema:

| To-Dos | Date Assigned | Date Complete | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To-do | 3.1.22 | 3.5.22 | 0 |
| To-do 2 | 3.5.22 | 3.5.22 | 1 |

- Priority can be in the range of (-1 through 3) -1 being lowest priority, 3 is top priority
- Download your To-Dos as .csv (only downloading selected collumns and rows)
- And name the document 'ToDos.csv' and place in the same folder
- Run the script to analyze To-Do productivity and sort for the next To-Dos'
- See the example .csv file (ToDos.csv) attached in this repository
